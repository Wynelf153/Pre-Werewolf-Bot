# Werewolf-Bot
This discord bot allows players to enjoy a text-based game of werewolf in discord!<br />
Unlike other discord bot, this werewolf bot anonymizes players by using discord webhooks, utilising bots to speak for players.<br />

This project is still in development, please stay tuned.

To run the bot (TAKE CAUTION THAT IT'S INCOMPLETE), put your token into ``token.txt`` and run ``bot.py``.

Working Commands:<br />
Run ``$setup`` to setup category channels and text channels for signup and hosting.<br />
In werewolf-signup, run ``$register`` to join the queue, ``$unregister`` to leave.<br />
In werewolf-hosting, run ``$start`` to start the game.
